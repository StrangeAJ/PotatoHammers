Nowadays common Home appliances like bulbs can be easily controlled wirelessly via integrating them with wireless technologies like Bluetooth rather than switching buttons. Problem with this is we require an user-friendly interface to interact with the hardware.

We have developed an Android application based on Java.
Using Java and Android SDK (Written in Java) an App is developed for
sending necessary signals to the Bluetooth module of hardware in a User Interactive Way.
